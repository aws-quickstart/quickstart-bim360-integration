.Partner Solution architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Partner Solution sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** A Linux bastion host in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Secure
Shell (SSH) access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in public and private subnets.*
* In the private subnets:
** BIM 360 integration application server instances across both Availability Zones, to ensure high availability.
** Auto Scaling enabled for the BIM 360 integration nodes cluster, to automatically add or remove servers based on their use. Auto Scaling provides additional servers during peak hours and lowers costs by removing servers during off hours. This functionality is tightly integrated with the Application Load Balancer, and automatically adds and removes instances from the load balancer. The default installation sets up low and high CPU-based thresholds for scaling the instance capacity up or down. You can modify these thresholds during launch and after deployment.
* Elastic Load Balancing, which provides HTTP and HTTPS load balancing across the BIM 360 integration instances. This Quick Start uses an Application Load Balancer, which is configured to use either HTTP or HTTPS.
* Optionally, Amazon Route 53 as your public Domain Name System (DNS) for resolving your BIM 360 integration siteâ€™s domain name. When you choose to deploy an application with a custom domain and Security Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate, a new RecordSet in your pre-existing Route 53 Hosted Zone is created.
* AWS Systems Manager parameters in the Systems Manager Parameter Store to securely store the Forge client ID, secret, and callback URL.
