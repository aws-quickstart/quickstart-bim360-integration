// Include any postdeployment steps here, such as steps necessary to test that the deployment was successful. If there are no postdeployment steps, leave this file empty.

== Postdeployment steps

=== Update the Forge callback URL

This step is required only if you did not specify a value for the Forge callback URL or Forge site domain parameters when launching the CloudFormation stack. If you have a valid Forge callback URL for your application, you can skip this step.

==== Update the SSM parameter

. From the CloudFormation outputs section, note the value of *ForgeCallbackURLParameter*.
. In the AWS Systems Manager console, navigate to Parameter Store, and then select the *Forge Callback URL SSM Parameter*. Choose *Edit*.
. In the *Value* field, enter the *Forge Callback URL* output, and then choose *Save changes*.

==== Update the Autodesk Forge app

. In your Forge portal, go to the app you are using for the BIM 360 integration, and then choose *Edit*.
. In the *Callback URL* field, enter the *Forge Callback URL*, and then choose *Save*.

=== Test the deployment

When the AWS CloudFormation template has successfully created the stack, all server nodes will be running with the BIM 360 integration installed in your AWS account.

. To access the application, in your preferred browser, go to the BIM 360 integration application URL listed in the *Outputs* tab shown earlier, if no Forge callback URL was specified.

A default page prompts you to log in to your BIM 360 account using your Autodesk ID.
