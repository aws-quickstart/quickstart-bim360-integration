## Autodesk BIM 360 Integration on AWS

This Quick Start deploys an Autodesk BIM 360 integration environment on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud in about 15 minutes.

BIM 360 is a unified platform that connects project workflows and computer-aided design (CAD) data from construction management software in real time. Using AWS as the integration host provides an extra layer of security, scalable computing power, vast data storage, and rich content delivery.

Built on an open and secure application programming interface (API)—the Autodesk Forge platform—BIM 360 enables you to integrate with other construction management software, to maintain a common data environment. With this integration, you can connect BIM 360 data and project workflows to save time, avoid data duplication, explore new workflows, and access information in one place.

This Quick Start is for IT infrastructure architects, administrators, and DevOps professionals who plan to implement or extend their BIM 360 integration workloads on AWS.

The AWS CloudFormation templates included with the Quick Start automate the following:

- Deploying BIM 360 into a new virtual private cloud (VPC)
- Deploying BIM 360 into an existing VPC in your AWS account

You can also use the AWS CloudFormation templates as a starting point for your own implementation.
